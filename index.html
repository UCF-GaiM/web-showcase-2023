        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Our team invested countless hours creating Mashed, a social recipe-sharing app that embodies our love for
          food and
          community. Over the course of 9 months and 8 milestones, we worked hard to develop a user-friendly interface
          with
          easy-to-use social interactions that encourage content sharing and connection. We aimed to allow people to
          share/edit
          recipes, explore new cuisines, and challenge themselves and others to cooking challenges. Shelby and Laura
          played a
          pivotal role in shaping the app's visual aesthetic and content strategy, while Naomy and Alan tackled Front
          and
          Back-end
          Development. We worked tirelessly to ensure that the app's core functionality was implemented seamlessly,
          including
          sign-ups, logins, recipe sharing, and user identification, and accurately portrayed the designs created by
          Shelby and
          Laura. To connect the app to the database, we used React Native and PHP to send JSON data between the two and
          connect
          to
          a MySQL database to store and display user data. The result was a full-fledged recipe application that parsed
          through
          various recipe and food data to create a memorable experience. Together, we are proud to have created a
          platform that
          brings people together through food and encourages exploration, creativity, and community building.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Over the course of two semesters, our group collaborated on a project to create a travel itinerary website
          called
          Vacation Base. The first semester was focused on the design phase while the second semester was dedicated to
          building
          the website. Our goal was to create a platform that would provide travelers with a one-stop shop for planning
          their
          trips.</p>
        <p>Our user-friendly homepage houses categorized activities inside dynamic carousels such as Theme Park and
          Restaurants.
          One of the core features of Vacation Base is the Idea Base, where users can browse through a wide range of
          activities
          and attractions. This includes pre-planned itineraries, travel tips, and blogs to help users plan their trips.
          To make
          the planning process even easier, we developed an itinerary builder with a drag-and-drop feature that allows
          users to
          customize their itinerary based on their preferences. We also added a search page with a variety of filters,
          such as
          minimum age, budget, family-friendly and opening hours. We also included a profile page where users can create
          and edit
          their profile and view their previously saved itineraries. We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front
          end, and PHP
          and SQL to handle server-side tasks.</p>
        <p>Throughout the project, we worked collaboratively by dividing tasks based on our strengths and interests and
          supported
          each other throughout the process. By the end of the project, we were proud to have created a functional and
          user-friendly website that we believe will help travelers plan memorable vacations.

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Vallarta' Mexican Restaurant Website is a redesign of an existing webpage that contains essential information
          for a
          chain of Mexican restaurants. The original site lacked organization, basic services, and accessibility
          practices. When
          first tackling this redesign, we made note of what makes other similar sites successful and convenient to use.
          We then
          added functioning essential services such as a reservation system, a personal account setup function, location
          maps, and
          online ordering. The entire website was rebranded with a new color scheme, a new logo, and corresponding
          styling. Our
          redesign is a responsive website that works best on desktop full screen, but it also works well in mobile
          view. We
          operated a user-centered approach that kept functionality as its top priority.

          browsers and modern technology, fostering a community of bibliophiles to explore new titles and support local

          implemented a user-friendly custom admin panel enabling the merchant to control important aspects of the
          website such as
          managing users, orders, and reviews without the need of a dedicated developer. Overall, we successfully
          achieved our

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>RideRaters is a theme park attraction rating app that rates attractions from various theme parks located in
          Florida. The
          focus is on accessibility, personalization, list creation, and ease of access to information. Users should
          feel
          comfortable and confident when deciding on what theme park attractions would best suit their visit by offering
          mobile
          'on the go' quick searching while on vacation and within the theme parks themselves. The project is both an
          innovation
          of a theme park rollercoaster review and blogging applications, as this is an untapped market that has not
          seen many
          applications. Incorporating HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, enables our application to employ consistent
          style and
          responsiveness for a successful user experience.
